    Description (English)
    [Machine Translation] My name is Adriana Tapia SÃ¡nchez, I am 19 years old and currently attends the 2nd semester in
    the career of TSU Tourism Hotel Area, at the Technological University of San Miguel de Allende. I am part of the
    Young Forward family since last year, I start my career already being part of this family, my career consists of 3
    years 8 months, the first 2 years I will be studying what is the TSU (University Superior Technician) and the 1 year
    and 8 months remain I will be studying the Bachelor's degree, obtaining 2 degrees throughout my career, I started my
    university studies in September 2018 and will be finishing my full career in 2022.
    <br>
    As I began to know the generalities of the career I chose, I completely fall in love since my prospects of the race
    were higher than what I had I really liked what I have known to the moment, the related hotels, the practices that
    eh done have been very nice and very satisfying for me because with them I've learned a lot more and eh shared more
    with my college classmates, as well as I've had very nice experiences when meeting places and new things, which I
    least liked from my carr it was the schedules that touched me, since on Monday I enter at 7:00 am and leave at 5:00
    pm, Tuesday and Thursday I enter at 8:00 am and I leave at 5:00 pm and on Wednesday and Friday I enter at 8:00 am
    and leave at 2:30 pm , although I have to meet my workshop hours also that sometimes I do the days I go out earlier
    and use them to do internships, therefore I almost always go to my house until 5:00 pm, but that is not an obstacle
    to decay on the contrary are for strengthen my desire to continue studying, my biggest challenge that I have faced
    during my stay in college has been to meet and relate to guys who have a very different thought to mine, because of
    the kind of place and school we come, but that has not limited me to give my best and much less has been an obstacle
    that I could not overcome, another challenge has been to lose the fear when i stand before my classmates and
    teachers to speak or expose some topic, but gradually I have overcome it as well as controlled my nerves. One of my
    greatest academic achievements has been to increase my qualification and to be able to perform my duties properly
    when doing internships and too extensive work, as well as being able to organize with my colleagues to work in some
    practice.
    <br>
    I want to finish my career and be a Bachelor of Tourism Management and Development and I know that I will achieve it
    with your support and with my effort and dedication, my mind is very focused on giving the best of me in my studies,
    always enjoying and loving day by day what I am doing or, later after finishing this career I would like to study
    veterinary and continue to give the best, i goal is to meet venice, Italy during my stays, and I know that for that
    I have to give and leave the best of me in my studies, I thank you for the opportunid ad to be part of this Young
    Forward family, thanks to their young support and trust as I are fulfilling our dream and our goal of continuing to
    study. I bid farewell by sending a cordial greeting, thank you very much.
